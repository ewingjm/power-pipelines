## Introduction

When packing or unpacking a solution with the Solution Packager, a MappingFile.xml is used to [map](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/solution-packager-tool#use-the-map-command-argument) files that are built (e.g. plug-in assemblies or web resources) to the corresponding files in the solution. Solution *.cdsproj projects generated by the Power Apps CLI (e.g. using `pac solution init`) run the Solution Packager automatically. 

## Sample

The files in this folder will allow solutions to be versioned independently as part of the build based on Git commits and/or Git tags. To make use of this sample, move [Directory.Build.props](./Directory.Build.props), [Directory.Build.targets](./Directory.Build.targets), and [Get-GitVersionSolutionVersion.ps1](./Get-GitVersionSolutionVersion.ps1) into a folder where all of your *.cdsproj solution projects are descendants. For example, _src/solutions/Directory.Build.props_ (where your solution projects are nested under _src/solutions_).

If you are already using a _Directory.Build.targets_ and/or _Directory.Build.props_, copy the contents of these files into your files instead.
